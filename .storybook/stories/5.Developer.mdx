<h2>Using Event Delegation</h2>

Normally, event handlers can be added to the components as soon as they are `hydrated`. In many scenarios, however, elements are dynamically replaced by JavaScript or inserted later, e.g., when elements are loaded on the page. To reliably bind event handlers to the events, it is recommended to use event delegation. In this approach, the event listener is not registered directly on the element, but at the `document` level or a more specific node. The advantage is that the element does not have to exist at this point. So you do not have to wait for hydration or the element itself. The custom event with the prefix `easycredit-` avoids collisions with other components or functions.

```html
<script>
(async () => {
    document.addEventListener('easycredit-submit', (e) => {
        if (!e.target.matches('easycredit-checkout')) {
          return;
        }
        
        console.log('submit!');
    })
})();
</script>
```

<h2>Waiting for Component Initialization with `whenDefined`</h2>

To be able to address the components and their methods, the respective element must be defined. To determine whether a component can already be addressed, the `whenDefined` function can be used:

```html
<script>
(async () => {
    await customElements.whenDefined('easycredit-checkout');
    const checkoutComponent = document.querySelector('easycredit-checkout')
    if (checkoutComponent) {
        checkoutComponent.dispatchEvent( new Event( 'openModal' ) );
    }
})();
</script>
```
