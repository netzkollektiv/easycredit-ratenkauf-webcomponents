<h1>easyCredit Web Components</h1>

<p>The easyCredit Web Components are a set of web components that can be universally used in e-commerce platforms such as Magento, Shopware, or WooCommerce. The web components simplify the integration of the easyCredit payment solution through versatile web frontend elements for marketing, checkout, and merchant management.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

To integrate the Web Components into any system, add the following lines to the `<head>` of your shop:

```html
<script type="module" src="https://ratenkauf.easycredit.de/api/resource/webcomponents/v3/easycredit-components/easycredit-components.esm.js"></script>
```

Now you can use any of the components within your website:

```html
<easycredit-widget amount="500" webshop-id="1.de.1234" />
```

The components are not fully loaded upon inclusion, but are instead loaded asynchronously when inserted into the page. This means the overhead caused by the inclusion is negligible.
