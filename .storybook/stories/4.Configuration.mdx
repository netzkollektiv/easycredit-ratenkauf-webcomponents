<h1>Configuration</h1>

The components can be configured via a global variable for integration and testing purposes. 
This is helpful for passing authorization details to the API or setting certain other required 
headers for the requests. The base URL of the API can also be changed here for testing purposes. 

<h2>Endpoints for Merchant Components</h2>

Typically, the merchant components interact with an (to be created) API of the shop system, 
which acts as a proxy and addresses the easyCredit API. This is useful so that access data is not disclosed in the backend. Modern shop systems already communicate 
via an API with the backend system, so a corresponding auth token can often also be used for the extended API. The endpoints for this 
can be set with the following configuration:

```html
<script>
window.easycreditRatenkaufWebComponentsConfig = {

    // defined proxy endpoints for merchant API, authentication in conjunction with request_config

    endpoints: {  // {transactionId} is automatically replaced with the tx-id or tx-id's (list)
        list: 'api/transactions/{transactionId}',
        get: 'api/transaction/{transactionId}',
        capture: 'api/transaction/{transactionId}/capture',
        refund: 'api/transaction/{transactionId}/refund'
    },

    [...]
}
</script>
```

<h2>Customizing the Request Header</h2>

The following example shows how the request header can be influenced. In this case, an already existing bearer token is used to authenticate against the API:

```html
<script>
window.easycreditRatenkaufWebComponentsConfig = {

    // The object `request_config` corresponds to the `options` parameter of `fetch(resource [, options])`, 
    // see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch

    request_config: {
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + Context.api.authToken.access
        }
    },

   [...]
}
</script>
```
<h2>Adjusting the Base URL for Testing Purposes</h2>

For testing purposes, the base URL for API requests can be adjusted. However, this is not necessary for normal use of the components.

```html
<script>
window.easycreditRatenkaufWebComponentsConfig = {

    // Base URL for API calls

    apiBaseUrl: 'https://ratenkauf.easycredit.de',

    [...]
}
</script>
```
